## Next Up — Ordered Execution Queue

### ✅ DONE: Gradebook ↔ Activity Integration (shipped 2026-03-07)

- `POST /api/v1/activities/{id}/push-to-gradebook` — score scaling, idempotency via `source_activity_id`
- "Push to Gradebook" button + modal on ActivityResultsPage
- QCM badge on assessments in gradebook; read-only grade cells for QCM-sourced grades
- 10 HTTP integration tests + 5 Playwright E2E

### ✅ DONE: Gradebook Audit & Gap Fix (shipped 2026-03-08)

- GradebookPage: working term + subject filter selects; assessment creation modal passes subject_id + term_id
- GradeEntryPage: student names resolved from group members (no more UUID slugs); QCM grades read-only
- StudentGradesPage: term filter dropdown; passes term_id to averages and subject drill-down
- Backend: `GET /gradebook/assessments/{id}` endpoint added
- 10 HTTP integration tests + 5 Playwright E2E

---

### ✅ DONE: Billing / Stripe Real Payments (shipped 2026-03-09)

- `POST /api/v1/wallet/create-payment-intent` — Stripe PaymentIntent creation with user/tenant metadata
- `POST /api/v1/stripe/webhook` — verifies Stripe signature, credits wallet on `payment_intent.succeeded` (idempotent via `stripe_payment_intent_id`)
- Celery worker + beat: `charge_subscriptions` (daily auto-debit by billing_period), `send_low_balance_alerts`
- SMTP low balance email when wallet below threshold
- Frontend: Stripe Elements (`CardElement`) in WalletPage; fallback to direct top-up in dev without Stripe keys
- Migration `d1e2f3a4b5c6`: `stripe_payment_intent_id` on `wallet_transactions`
- 10 HTTP integration tests + 5 Playwright E2E

---

### ✅ DONE: Real-Time Notifications (shipped 2026-03-10)

- Producers added to homework (assign → notify students), gradebook (bulk grades → notify student), activity (live session start → notify group, replay enabled → notify group)
- All producers wrapped in `try/except` — never block main flow
- `GET /api/v1/notifications/stream` — SSE endpoint via Redis pub/sub with heartbeat + cleanup
- `GET /api/v1/notifications/unread-count` — fast badge count
- Frontend: `useNotifications` uses SSE-first with 30s polling fallback; NotificationPanel auto-refreshes on open
- 10 HTTP integration tests + 5 Playwright E2E

---

### ✅ DONE: Enrollment Module (shipped 2026-03-11)

- `EnrollmentRequest` model: parent/child info, status workflow (pending→reviewing→approved→rejected), documents, admin notes
- Migration `e2f3a4b5c6d7`: `enrollment_requests` table
- Service: on approval auto-creates student `User` + assigns role + adds `GroupMembership`
- Endpoints: `POST /enrollment`, `GET /enrollment`, `GET /enrollment/my`, `GET /enrollment/{id}`, `PATCH /enrollment/{id}/review`
- Notifications: admins alerted on new request; parent alerted on each status change
- Admin UI: status filter tabs, review table, approve/reject modal with notes
- Parent UI: submit form (pre-filled from auth), my requests list with status badges
- Routes: `/admin/enrollment` (admin-guarded), `/enrollment` (parent-facing)
- 10 HTTP integration tests + 5 Playwright E2E

---

### ✅ DONE: PWA + Mobile/Tablet Layout (shipped 2026-03-12)

**PWA:**
- `vite-plugin-pwa` + Workbox: autoUpdate service worker, web app manifest
- NetworkFirst for API routes (timetable, grades, homework) — works offline with last-fetched data
- CacheFirst for static assets (30-day cache)
- `InstallPrompt` banner: shows on eligible browsers, dismissable, standalone-mode aware
- index.html: full PWA meta tags (theme-color, apple-mobile-web-app-*, description)

**Mobile/tablet layout audit:**
- All tables wrapped with `overflow-x-auto` + negative margin bleed
- Filter rows stack vertically on mobile (`flex-col sm:flex-row`)
- Dashboard grids: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`
- Topbar breadcrumb truncated on mobile
- EnrollmentPage admin: card layout on mobile, table on md+
- Enrollment links added to MobileNav + Sidebar (admin + parent)

---

### ✅ DONE: School Gaps + Tutor CRM (shipped 2026-03-13)

**School gaps:**
- `absence_justifications` table: parent submits justification per absence date (reason, description, optional document URL), status workflow pending→accepted→rejected, admin/teacher review with notes
- `health_records` table: one-to-one per student — allergies, medical conditions, medications, blood type, emergency contact, doctor info
- Twilio SMS integration (`send_sms()`) — no-op when `SMS_ENABLED=false`; SMS sent on absence status change
- Migrations: `f3a4b5c6d7e8` (absence/health)

**Tutor CRM:**
- `tutoring_sessions`: date, duration, rate per session, status (scheduled/completed/cancelled/no_show), homework given, package link, invoiced flag
- `tutoring_packages`: session bundles (total/used), price, paid status
- `tutoring_invoices`: auto-generated from uninvoiced completed sessions, line items (JSONB), PDF download via reportlab, invoice number `INV-YYYYMM-XXXX`
- 9 REST endpoints: `/v1/tutoring/sessions`, `/packages`, `/invoices/generate`, `/invoices/{id}/pdf`, `/my-students`
- Frontend: 4-tab CRM page (My Students | Sessions | Packages | Invoices) with log-session modal, package modal, invoice generation
- Migration: `a4b5c6d7e8f9` (tutoring tables)

## Tech Debt / Known Issues

| Issue | Where | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Notification producers missing | All modules | ✅ Fixed — homework, gradebook, activity producers added |
| Activity scores not in gradebook | Activities + Gradebook | ✅ Fixed — push-to-gradebook bridge |
| WS answer store is in-memory | session_ws.py | Persist to Redis for multi-pod (post-MVP) |
| Open questions score 0 | scoring.py | Manual grading flow for open QCM (backlog) |
| Vite dev server in production | VM port 3000 | Replace with nginx serving dist/ + proxy /api (post-MVP) |
| Cloudflare 100s WS idle timeout | Live sessions | Frontend reconnects on close — acceptable for now |
